# 1380A
1380A Vex High Stakes (24-25)  Code

Made By Johan Kornet, Utilizing Robodash, LemLib, and PROS in VSCode

Quick Rundown:

main.cpp -> main file, contains the competition template

autons.cpp -> Contains LemLib settings, alongside Robodash callbacks and autons/the auton selector

devices.cpp -> contains pistons, motors, driver control functions, PID and colorsort functions (deprecated), and controller HUD functions for displaying DT temperature and auton selecting

static -> contains Jerry.io auton pathing for pure pursuit
Good Luck!
